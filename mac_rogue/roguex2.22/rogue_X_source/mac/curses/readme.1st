This source code for curses was originally written and released by LarryGensch.  I have modified it substantially both in order to make in run on theMacintosh and to include some additional functionality.  I have includedLarry's original README file unmodified.  Following is some information aboutwhat is new to my release.  I'll apologize ahead of time that mydocumentation is not clearer and more organized.  I'm leaving the country forthe summer in about a week, and when I get back I'm moving to Boston to go backto school during which time I hope to be doing little or no programming.  Soits clear that I better post this stuff now or never.  I hope it is useful tosomebody.  It should be clear from the above that I'm not in a position tosupport this code, though I have tested it fairly extensively.  I suspect thatI will be reachable at the e-mail addresses I listed below for a while (thoughnot June-August 1994), and I will be happy to try to answer questions thatanyone has.  If you find the code useful, I'd like to hear about that too.

Added support for pads and subwindows.New files	v_doscur.c	(was v_msdos.c)	v_maccur.c	Macintosh-specific code.	v_maccur.r	Basic resources used by Macintosh curses.	macurses.h	Macintosh specific header.	readme.mac	Macintosh specific implementation notes.Extensions	My main extension to the library are pads and sub-windows (and sub-pads).	I also implemented getstr and scanw.	List of new functions:		prefresh	pnoutrefresh	subwin	newpad	subpad	pechochar	copywin	overwrite	overlay	ungetch	wgetstr	scanw	mvscanw	wscanw	mvwscanw	vwscanw	I added the following members to the WINDOW structure:    short	_pmap_orgy, _pmap_orgx;	/* Upper left corner of most recent prefresh on pad. */    short	_pmap_maxy, _pmap_maxx;	/* Max x/y of most recent prefresh on pad. */    short	_xdim;					/* Value to add to chtype pointer to move down a row. */Changes to machine specific code	I changed to name of the MSDOS specific source file to v_doscur.c, since	v_msdos seemed a bit too generic (no way to tell it had anything to do	with curses).  The screen redrawing routine had to be rewritten somewhat	to take account of the needs of pads and sub-windows.	In order to make it easier to support multiple machine implementations,	I used the following macros to point to the machine-specific functions:	CURS_INIT_FN	CURS_REFRESH_FN	CURS_END_FN	CURS_BEEP_FN	CURS_KBINP_FN	CURS_FLUSHINP_FN	The final macro on this list (CURS_FLUSHINP_FN) is optional.  If it is	defined, the function refered to is called by flushinp to flush typeahead	characters not yet buffered by wgetch.	There is some code to support interactions with the system under Watcom's	DOS/3GW 32-bit linear executable format.
