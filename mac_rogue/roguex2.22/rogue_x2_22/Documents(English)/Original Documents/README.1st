----This is a macine-translated document, if you are confused by reading this, please read original document in japanese. ----Introduction--------------------------------------------------This is a source of 'Two Japanese rogue clone version 1.3'distributed with fj.binaries.msdos. [It] decided to contribute to fj.sources again because there was a demand that [it] wanted to transplant it to OS other than MS-DOS. UNIX?-----------------------------------------------The original run on UNIX. This version run by UNIX, too, if the change part of a Japanese message etc. is excluded. If the state as it is Ågmake-f Makefile.nix" is executed in BSD UNIX, rogue clone 2 of the black and white display can be done in an English message. Please execute it for System V after changing setting in Makefile.nix. However, it is not likely to be able to compile obediently because [it] does not test. Japanese and color--------------------------------------------When rogue clone 2 of a Japanese message or displaying in colors is made, it is necessary to use the curses routine of the attachment. Because this curses thinks the number of bytes of characters to be the same as the width of the display, Kanji character code which can be used is EUC except shift JIS or the normal-width Japanese syllabary. Because it is only a part to assume shift JIS in the code where keyboard input is done with message.c, it seems that the Japanese message display can be achieved comparatively easily only by the change in the output part as long as the input of the Chinese character is given up. However, the problem might occur if termcap which this curses has for myself does not correct the hit because [it] does not interpret padding information by the negligent one. Attention------------------------------------------------------A Japanese character string is buried as it is in the code. It should be originally a shifted JIS code on MS-DOS though this is expressed by JIS code. [It] does not move even if [it] takes to MS-DOS as it is and [it] compiles. Please use the source contributed to fj.binaries.msdos if you want to use it by MS-DOS. To tell the truth, there are some changes from the source contributed to fj.binaries.msdos. The change does not include the change in a part alone which relates to UNIX as for MS-DOS. Please look at the file named Patch.2me about the difference. If the patch is applied to the source contributed to fj.binaries.msdos with this file, [it] becomes the same as the source distributed at this time. At the end----------------------------------------------------There is a description in README.doc about the use condition others of this source, and see that, please. Then, Enjoy happy hacking. ----------------------------------------------------------1989.9.26 ohta@src.ricoh.co.jp (Junn Ohta)------------------------------------------------^^^^------
