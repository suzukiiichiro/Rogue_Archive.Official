Because it was impossible, the clone has been made for myself though original person's Tim Stoehr wanted to see rogue, obtain the source of the program. And, it is possible to have felt after everyone by putting the source of the rogue clone on the public domain. I transplanted it on MS-DOS though this original rogue clone (Ah It was confusing) was a program which moved on UNIX. I can have executed it on most MS-DOS machines which were able to use Japanese including the PC-9801 series of NEC Corporation. A big change was to have made the message Japanese and to have made it to the color. Because the source was fiddled here and there and turned at the stage, it seems that bugs of a considerable number lurk (:- which actually lurks). These bugs are not the original person but my all responsibilities. *About the copyright-----------------------------------------------------------It is free, and every two Japanese rogue clone version 1.3 freely uses, modifies, and can distribute the copy again including the source and the execution file. An onerous distribution by the amount of money of reprint and commission + media money level etc. to various nets go freely and are excellent without the inquiry of the author as long as [it] meets the following requirements. The condition is three that [it] does not sell aiming at the (1) profit, all (2) documents are attached, and the limitation is not added to use, the modification, and the re-distribution of the source by which (3) is distributed and the execution file. However, two Japanese rogue clone version 1.3 is not PDS. I (Jun Ohta) have the copyright and the writer character right about the change part from original rogue clone 2. Whether [it] obtained it by any route is assumed to be the one to give non-monopolistic use right to all men who have two Japanese rogue clone version 1.3 about the copyright part among these regardless of. The writer character right is assumed to be the one that this will not be exercised during the future though has by Jun Ohta. Original rogue clone 2(one except the part enclosed from the source program with # ifdef MSDOS, COLOR, JAPAN, TOPSCO, and ANSI) is PDS in an original meaning, and when using it, any limitation is not received. However, [it] hopes to make meeting this demand as long as it is possible to do because the original person is demanding to specify that it is an original person not to remove the annotation at the head of the (1) source program when the source of this program is distributed, and nor to have made the (2) source program, and not to obtain a personal profit (3) by this source program. *To compile the rogue clone-------------------------------------The source program of the MS-DOS version can be compiled to either of Microsoft-C(4.0,5.1), Turbo-C(1.5,2.0) or Lattice-C(4.0) compiler and the compiler by the MAKE program of the attachment. There is an inquiry in the source about the kind of the compiler which has it and the MAKE program when INSTALL.BAT of the attachment is executed, and Makefile is made automatically afterwards. If MAKE is executed for this Makefile, the execution file of the rogue clone is made. An environmental version cannot be used for Turbo-C, and compile in the command line version, please. Please add the message to the display of the version in ‘play.c' when you change the source program, and leave the career of the change. *To play by the rogue clone-----------------------------------------------First of all, please read ROGUE.DOC for the first time if you do rogue. A basic way to play is written in this. Please read OPTIONS.DOC if you want to learn the method of setting the floppy disk for the game of the person and MS-DOS to know how to play. ROGUE.MAN is an easy manual modeled on UNIX command manual, and the one that what attached to original rogue clone 2 was translated into Japanese. There are the following concerning rogue. ・Rogue handbook \1,500 (game handbook series 3)Written by Masatoshi Takeyama, Nobuyuki Kimura, and  Masataka Oota Takashi , BNN issue*About the player menu---------------------------------------------ROGUE.COM filing the distribution is a menu command for two or more men to play rogue with one MS-DOS machine. The player up to ten people is registered on the menu, and an independent name and the saving file can be given respectively. The saved game is automatically restarted. The operation method is easy, and is a cancellation by the selection, execution, and the escape by the cursor movement, space or the return with H, J, K, and L key. When the name is registered and changed, the back space (one character deletion) and CTRL-U (one line deletion) are also effective. The cursor key can be used in PC-9801 instead of H, J, K, and L key. Please choose 'A. the player registration'from the menu, and register the name of the player according to the displayed message when the first playing with rogue (The Chinese character can be used for the player name). The game starts if the player will be chosen from next time with H, J, K, and L key and space is pushed. ROGUE.COM sets option name of environment variable USER and rogue and file based on player information originally managed, and starts ROGUE.EXE which is the execution of rogue file. Therefore, when rogue is played by way of ROGUE.COM, environment variable USER and ROGUEOPT9 temporarily become invalid. *The main difference in game progress with original rogue 5.3-----------------It is easy in the whole though a basic strategy is the same as the original. ・All are seen in the room at the same time as entering always brightly. ・The mapping of the maze is different. ・There is a large room). ・If the scroll and the liquid medicine are used once, the effect is clarified. ・The property can be dropped also to the entrance in the room. *The main change point in two Japanese rogue clone version 1.2-----------------------・Transplant to MS-DOS・Message, for Japanese of input, and for color screen・The same player can be recorded two or more times in a top score. ・Addition of various options（passgo, color, map, dir, type, init, term, cursor）It is the one having basically aimed at the compromise to the original as follows. ・Change in game end screen・Addition of passgo function(In the movement command, do not stop in the corner in the passage. )・Addition of various commands（?, !, D, o, a, @, /）・Array changing according to kind of property list*The main change point in two Japanese rogue clone version 1.3-----------------------・Reduction in size of execution file and improvement of execution speed・When the alias is put on an unknown property, the bug that the kind of the property is understood from D command is corrected. ・Correction of bug that isolated room can be done・Reinforcement of signal processing and raw mode processing・Correction of something wrong which was not able to be compiled normally in MSA version Turbo-C1.5・The memory model in Microsoft-C is changed to the medium model. ・Correspondence to Turbo-C2.0 and Lattice-C4.0・The screen dump command is changed from “%" to “CTRL-D". ・Change of default value of passgo and color option・Deletion of fullansi option・Correspondence to AX machine and NEC PC100 and offing if-800 series・Correspondence of player menu to each model modelAs a result of the change, a part of content of the saving file is different. The saving file of Japanese version 1.2 cannot be renewed in Japanese version 1.3. *Already-known bug---------------------------------------------------------------At present, the following bugs turn out. ・It is likely to advance to a new floor or to hang up. ・The passage which was adjacent to the player after the monster moves might not be displayed. ・[It] drives recklessly when the rogue clone is ended if the rogue clone compiled by Lattice C is started from the player menu compiled by Lattice C occasionally.
