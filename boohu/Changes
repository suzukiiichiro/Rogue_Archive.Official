v0.9.0 2018-07-25

Items and Monsters:

+ New monster: winged milfids that can make you swap positions.
+ New monster: mad nixe, that can throw an attracting magic bolt to you, moving
  you to a square adjacent to the monster (the one corresponding to LOS ray).
+ Now hounds can smell you in a short range: this means that fog and
  dense foliage are not always enough to flee from them.
+ New weapon: har-kar gauntlets which you used “unarmed”: it is a (weak)
  two-handed weapon that has a particular attack patern: if there is a free cell
  after monsters in a given direction, you hit every monster in the path, move
  after them, and hit another monster (if any), which can be very useful in
  corridors, as well as for escaping.
+ Double sword got renamed into berserk sword, which occasionally makes you
  berserk when attacking while severely injured.
+ Sword got renamed into sabre, and its mechanics were changed too: now this
  weapon has better accuracy the more injured the monster is.
+ New dancing rapier weapon: it makes you swap positions with monsters you
  attack, attempting a hit to any monster behind in the same direction, with
  extra damage.
+ Axes now deal 1-2 extra damage in open areas - actually when neighbor
  cells common to you and the monster do not have any walls. The idea is
  to make risky non-corridor fights potentially optimal with axes.
+ New defender flail weapon: it hits harder the more you keep attacking without
  moving; moreover, moving toward a monster moves the monster to you instead.
+ New robes: speed robe, celmist robe and harmonist robe. These armours give
  you no physical protection. The first make you speedy. The celmist robe makes
  you better at using rods (better recharge rate, more mana and an extra charge),
  and harmonist robe makes you better at being stealthy (slightly reduced LOS
  range, stealthy movement and a less good version of Frundis staff noise
  mitigation). There has been some work for rebalancing stealth.
+ Old plate armour got renamed into chain mail (which is gone).
+ New ponderousness plates armour appeared that gives great protection at a
  movement speed cost.
+ New armour: smoking scales that leaves a short-lived fog behind you each time
  you move. It really is useful to escape from monsters in corridors, less so in
  open areas.
+ New armour: scintillating plates, good protection but +1 LOS range.
+ New shields: bashing, confusing and earth shields that occasionally on block
  have a special effect. Bashing moves the monsters several squares away in a
  direction. Confusing just confuses the monster. The earth shield gives much
  more protection than the others, but impacts produce a noisy sound that can
  destruct nearby walls, which sometimes can be bad (for example in a corridor)
  or good (due to the resulting fog).
+ New rod: rod of lightning, an electricity attack to every monster connected
  to you (similar to lightning whip, but for a rod). A little less strong per
  monster than fireball, but probably stronger overall.
+ New rod: rod of sleeping, that makes monsters sleep in a 1-radius square area.
+ New potion of shadows: LOS range of 1 for a short time.
+ New projectile: night magara that produces sleep inducing clouds 
+ Reduced duration for potion of swapping, it was OP.

Other gameplay changes:

+ Three new optional levels up to Depth:15! Each of those has normal
  downstairs, and magical stairs leading you out (except Depth:14). This way on
  good runs you can chose to go for more challenge.
+ New aptitude: “you have good ears”. It makes you hear monster footsteps
  with higher probability and with range improved by 1.
+ One or two levels per game get special fauna, with monster bands related to a
  particular monster or theme.
+ Sometimes some lonely out of depth monsters can appear in early levels, for
  more diversity early on.
+ Now there is always at least two weapons generated per game, so that you have
  a choice before the last levels.
+ More game statistics.

User Interface:

+ New web version with 16x24 tiles, and much improved mouse support.
+ There is now a setting in-game to change default LOS color to a dark one, for
  less contrast.
+ Now in compact 80x24 layout you see a log line even in target mode.
+ Improved the settings menu: now you can toggle normal/compact layout and
  tiles/ascii mode.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.0 2018-06-02

Game related changes:

+ No more automatic HP and MP regeneration: now you have to rest. This
  is inspired from TGGW, but adapted to Boohu's fast-paced flow and
  DCSS-like short temporal effects: you have to wait for your status to wear
  off before resting (the first attempt waits for this), and then you attempt
  to rest and are successful at it if you are not interrumpted by monsters
  during a few turns. You replenish HP and MP, monsters do too, and some
  monsters might awake when you rest, so that you want to avoid doing it too
  often.
+ Reworked cyclops: less accurate, rocks do never confuse, but the rocks create
  temporal obstacles (walls) for the player. The placement of the rock depends on
  whether the player dodged (rock behind the player), blocked with the shield
  (rock in front of the player), or got hit (the rock takes player cell if
  possible, and the player gets 1 cell moved backwards).
+ Renamed worms into farmer worms: they now furrow and help foliage grow as
  they move.
+ New potion of digging that lets you walk into walls for a few turns.
+ New potion of dreams: you get the current location of sleeping monsters.
+ New potion of swapping that makes you dance with monsters (swap positions)
  when you move or are hit by them.
+ Explosive magara and nadre explosions now can occasionally destroy walls.
+ Removed javelines: some of their damage integrated in darts of confusion,
  which are more funny and versatile.
+ Improvements in dungeon generation: new town-like map generator,
  special rooms and/or foliage in most maps.
+ Improved morgue files. They now show some miscellaneous statistics at the
  end, including some per-depth statistics.

User interface:

+ Improved mouse support: now there are several buttons for the more common
  actions, instead of one huge menu.
+ New compact alternative style for 80x24 terminals.
+ The game tries to display several log messages in one line when there is
  enough room for it (the algorithm could still be improved).
+ Improved animations. Animations can be disabled with `-n` option.

A few bug fixes and many other little improvements.
