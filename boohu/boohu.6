.Sh DESCRIPTION
Break Out Of Hareka's Underground (Boohu) is a roguelike game mainly inspired
from DCSS and its tavern, with some ideas from Brogue, but aiming for very
short games, almost no character building, and a simplified inventory.

Every year, the elders send someone to collect medicinal simella plants in the
Underground.
This year, the honor fell upon you, and so here you are.
According to the elders, deep in the Underground, magical stairs will lead you
back to your village.
Along the way, you will collect simellas, as well as
various items that will help you deal with monsters, which you may
fight or flee...
