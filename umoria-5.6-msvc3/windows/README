Building:

 To build in Visual Studio 2013, open the files vs2013\umoria.sln and build it.

 Note that you will need NuGet and an internet connection for VS2013 to be able to automatically download and install PDCurses in order to build.


Installing:

 After building, run makedist.bat to set up a dist subfolder with all the necessary files in it.


Running:

 After building and installing, run moria.exe from the dist subfolder.

 Running from the Visual Studio debugger is not supported at this time.
