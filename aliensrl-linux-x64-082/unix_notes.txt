Known issues with Unix (Linux, FreeBSD) AliensRL versions:

1. AliensRL looks for it's data files inside current directory, what 
   means that

   a. you should always run aliensrl from the directory where the binary is
      (e.g. using a script like `cd /<aliensrl-directory>/; ./aliensrl').

   b. it's not possible to install aliensrl system-wide.

2. It's known that AliensRL upon exit leaves the console in kind of
   messy state. This seems to be a problem in FPC Video unit
   and so far we didn't manage to find a solution.

Also, AliensRL requires that your console has size 80x25 or larger.
So make sure to adjust size of your console if needed.

You can run AliensRL using one of the scripts aliensrl_gnome-terminal,
aliensrl_konsole, aliensrl_xterm etc. provided in the release.
They run the game in new X terminal window (so the 2nd issue is not
noticed), and set window size to be exactly 80x25.
You can add at their beginning a line like
  cd /<aliensrl-directory>/
to somewhat get rid of the 1st issue too.
