ABOUT THE GAME
This is Martin's Seven-Day Roguelike, aka "mpr7drl", written by me (Martin
Read) in less than 168 hours total wall time (total of the time I spent
eating, sleeping, working, coding mpr7drl, playing Nethack, playing SFB,
playing Angband variants, talking on the phone, arranging to rent a new
flat, going to the pub to talk about Nethack, reading Livejournal, reading
Usenet, ...).

KNOWN BUGS AND INFELICITIES:
* Reloading can corrupt some of the map data; I can't work out quite what's
  going wrong here.
* print_obj_name() and print_mon_name() are insufficiently sophisticated.
* The game balance blows goats.
* The AI sucks rocks through a straw.

But hey.  It's a roguelike written in 3600 lines of C in 168 hours, so what
are you expecting?  The next Nethack?
