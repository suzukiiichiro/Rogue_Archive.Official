Version: 0.3
2004-02-15
Ashwin N. <ashwin@despammed.com>

Ashwin N <ashwin@despammed.com>
* Header files added for all source files. #includes of these files added
  to all source files to replace the former dirty way of using externs.
* Makefile
  Prerequisites are generated automatically. Needs some more work.
* Corrected tons of punctuation mistakes in the messages displayed to the
  player.
* static on functions removed. It was unnecessary in the first place.
* Unused extern variable declarations removed.
* Lots of beautification of code (mostly on braces).
* shorts converted to ints in lots of places.
* spec_hit.c file renamed to special_hit.c

Chris
* hit.c
  Integer math bug fixed in damage to armor.
* inventory.c
  The output is always sorted by the selection letter. The other change allows
  you to select an item from the inventory viewing screen. The second is how
  the old inventory() function ended up moved to inv_sel() with inventory()
  just becoming a call to inv_sel() with arguments.
* monster.c
  Added a function fix_mon_damage. This function corrects the damage pointer
  when loading a saved game for a monster. Prior to this fix, monsters already
  present on a level when saved were restored with random damage amounts. Most
  commonly unable to hit the player due to their damage being 0.
* move.c
  My changes are an attempt to enable following of tunnels between rooms. It
  gets a little funny when you are in one of those maze style rooms but works
  for the most part. Following of turns in the tunnels is only active for
  control and a direction. Such as ^H.
* object.c
  The weapon equivalent of the monster fix. It was very annoying to restore a
  saved game and suddenly only be able to hit a monster with the damage for
  your strength.
* pack.c
  Contains the remainder of the changes to allow selection during inventory
  display.
* play.c
  The changes to allow the / command to identify characters on the screen as
  per rogue-guide.txt.
* save.c
  Added code to call the functions to fix monster and weapon damages when
  restoring a saved file.
* rogue-guide.txt
  High bit characters changed to normal chars.

Version: 0.2.2
2004-01-15
Ashwin N <ashwin@despammed.com>

* V0.2.1 carried a corrupted AUTHORS file. The file has been repaired.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.2.1
2003-03-09
Ashwin N <ashwin@despammed.com>

Lots of fixes in 0.2.1. Most of the Segmentation Faults should disappear now.

* After seeking help (using ?) the dungeon map used to disappear. This is
  fixed.
* get_input_line was being called with the wrong parameters in lots of places.
  All of them are fixed. No more silly Segmentation Faults that were being
  reported should occur.
* Password has been changed from an eccentric one to "password"
* Command to create objects in wizard mode was Ctrl-C, now changed to Ctrl-/

  (Thanks to Matt <mattk@cyberonic.com> for pointing out all the above bugs
  and their fixes too.)

* Karl-Olov Serrander reported problems with getlogin() in function md_gln()
  under RH8. Replaced it with getpwnam() as he suggested.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.2
2003-02-21
Ashwin N <ashwin@despammed.com>

* The inbuilt curses/termlib emulation code (for systems which don't have
  ncurses) has been removed.
* All register variables changed to normal.
* All function declaration and definitions ANSI-fied from the old K&R style.
* All warnings fixed (a ton of them used to show up if I compiled with -Wall).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Verison: 0.1

* The latest version I could get my hands on when I looked for a Linux port of
  Rogue.
