THE DUNGEONS OF DOOM
--------------------

Introduction:

Rogue was introduced at the University of California at Berkeley as a
screen-oriented fantasy game.  The game had 26 types of monsters that
the player could meet while exploring a Dungeon generated by the computer.
Scrolls, potions, rings, wands, staves, armor, and weapons helped the
player to battle these monsters and to gain gold, the basis for scoring.

The version of rogue described in this guide has been expanded to include
over 200 monsters with many new capabilities and has been renamed xrogue.
Many of the monsters are intelligent and they, like the player, must avoid
traps and decide when it is better to fight or to run.  There are a number
of new commands in this version as well.

The game contains monsters, spells, weapons, armor, potions, and other
magical items that you will discover during your quest.  The Dungeon's
geography changes with every game and although many magical items have
certain identifiable properties, such as turning the player invisible,
the physical manifestation of the magic changes each game.  A red potion,
for example, will cause the same reaction throughout a given game, but
it may be a completely different potion in a new game.

Entering the Dungeon with only a little food, armor, and a weapon, the
player must develop a good strategy of when to fight, when to run, and
how to best use any magical item found in the Dungeon.  To make things
interesting the player has a quest to return one of several unique and
magical artifacts which are rumored to lie deep within the Dungeon.
Returning with this artifact to the surface brings great honor.

However, after finding the artifact, the player may wish to continue
his quest deeper into the Dungeon to match wits with an arch-devil, a
demon-prince, or perhaps Charon the Boatman.  Defeating such a creature
will gain the player many experience points which is the basis for
scoring in xrogue.  It is very difficult to return alive from the
Dungeons of Doom.  Very few players have ever made it out alive.

Character Classes:

Before placing the player in the Dungeon, the game requests that you
select what type of character they would like to be: Fighter, Paladin,
Ranger, Magic-User, Cleric, Thief, Assassin, Druid, or Monk.

    The Fighter

A Fighter has the best odds at winning battles with monsters.  At high
experience levels, the Fighter is able to attack his opponent multiple
times in a single turn.  Strength is the main attribute of the Fighter.

    The Magic-User

A Magic-User is able to cast spells.  Intelligence is the main attribute.
The number of spells a Magic-User can cast increases as he gains in
experience points and in intelligence.  His spell casting ability allows
him to identify any item in the Dungeon.  16 spells.

    The Cleric

A Cleric is able to pray for assistance in battle.  Wisdom is the main
attribute.  The number of prayers granted to the Cleric increases as he
gains in experience points and in wisdom.  Clerics can affect (turn) the
undead monsters to avoid battle.  Ie., zombies, ghouls, etc.  If the
Cleric is very powerful relative to the undead monster, turning it will
utterly destroy it.  16 prayers.

    The Paladin

A Paladin is a type of holy warrior, being a cross between a Cleric
and a Fighter.  He is able to pray and affect the undead like the Cleric
and fight like the Fighter, but both to a lesser extent.  He is on the
side of all that is righteous and good and would never attack a monster
that has not attacked him first.  If he happens to kill such a monster,
inadvertantly or otherwise, he will begin to feel increasingly uneasy.
If he kills too many such monsters, he will face karmic retaliation and
be reduced to a mere Fighter, minus all of the Cleric's ability.
Charisma is the main attribute with Wisdom second.

    The Ranger

A Ranger is a type of mystical warrior, being a cross between the
Magic-User and Fighter.  Like the Paladin, he is on the side of all
that is righteous and good and would never attack a monster that
has not attacked him first.  A Ranger is able to cast spells like the
Magic-User and fight like the Fighter, but both to a lesser extent.
Charisma is the main attribute with Intelligence second.

    The Thief

A Thief is exceptionally dexterous and has great skill at being able
to set a traps for and/or rob (steal) items from monsters.  Thieves have
the ability to detect all the gold and hidden traps on each level of
the Dungeon.  Their dexterous nature gives Thieves the ability to move
very quietly, so they are not as likely as to wake up sleeping monsters
as are the other character types.  If a Thief manages to sneak up on a
creature without waking it he may be able to backstab the monster.  The
damage from a backstab is greatly increased based upon the experience
level.  Dexterity is the main attribute.

    The Assassin

An Assassin is a person trained in the art of killing monsters by
surprise.  He has some of the abilities of the Thief, but he cannot
sense traps or backstab.  Instead, the Assassin has the chance to kill
an opponent outright with one deadly blow.  He can recognize and use
poison found in the Dungeon on his weapon, thereby, making his next
attack exceptionally lethal.  Dexterity is the main attribute.

    The Druid

A Druid is a type of magical warrior, being a cross between the Cleric
and the Magic-User.  A Druid can chant both spells and prayers plus a
few of his own.  The number of chants available to the Druid increases
as he gains in experience points and in Wisdom.  Wisdom is the main
attribute.  16 chants.

    The Monk

A Monk is trained in the martial arts.  He wears no armor and does not
need a weapon (although using them is not forbidden).  As the Monk gains
in experience points his natural defense or ability to dodge attackers
increases.  They are also a cross between the Druid and Fighter.  Monks
can chant and fight like the Fighter, but both to a lesser extent.
Constitution is the main attribute, with wisdom second.

Attributes Of The Charaters:

Strength - Strength is the primary attribute for encumberance.

Intelligence - Intelligence is the primary attribute for casting spells.

Wisdom - Wisdom is the primary attribute for prayers and chanting.

Dexterity - Dexterity is the primary attribute for stealthiness.

Charisma - Charisma is the primary attribute for good will.  High
           Charisma can affect your transactions and purchases as well.

Constitution - Constitution is the primary attribute for health.
               High Constitution can affect the amount of hit points
               you receive when moving up in experience levels.

Experience Levels:

Characters gain experience points mostly from killing monsters.  Other
actions, such as stealing items from monsters, backstabbing, and turning
monsters, also add a few experience points.  Each character type gains
experience points and moves up in experience levels at different rates.
Moving up in experience levels adds extra hit points to the character
which determine how many "hits" he can take before being killed.

Allocating Attribute Points To The Characters:

A player starts with 75 attribute points to distribute in to the character
he has chosen to play.  When you are prompted to distribute the attribute
points, the screen displays the minimum and maximum allowable values for
that particular attribute.  The player can type a backspace (Ctrl-H) to go
back and change a previous value and typing an escape (ESC) sets all the
remaining attributes to the maximum value possible, given the number of
remaining attribute points to be distributed.

THE SCREEN

During the normal course of play, the screen consists of three separate
sections:  the top line, the bottom two lines, and the remaining screen
in the middle.  The top line reports actions which occur during the game,
the middle section depicts the Dungeon, and the bottom two lines describe
the player's current condition.

Whenever anything happens to the player, such as finding a scroll, hitting
a monster, or being hit by a monster, a short report appears on the top
line of the screen.  When you see the word 'More' on the top line, that
means you must press the space key to continue.  Type-ahead is ignored.

The Following Items May Be Found Within The Dungeon. Some of them have
more than one interpretation, depending upon whether your character
recognizes them.

 |  A wall of a room.
 -  A wall of a room.
 *  A pile of gold.
 %  A way to the next level.
 +  A doorway.
 .  The floor in a room.
 #  The floor in a passageway.
    Solid rock (denoted by a space).
 ^  The entrance to a Trading Post
 @  The player.
 _  The player, when invisible.
 :  Some food.
 !  A flask containing a potion.
 ?  A sealed scroll.
 =  A ring.
 )  A weapon.
 ]  Some armor.
 ;  A miscellaneous magic item
 ,  An artifact
 /  A wand or a staff.
 >  A trapdoor leading to the next level
 {  An arrow trap
 $  A sleeping gas trap
 }  A beartrap
 ~  A trap that teleports you somewhere else
 `  A poison dart trap
 "  A shimmering magic pool
 '  An entrance to a maze
 $  Any magical item. (During magic detection)
 >  A blessed magical item. (During magic detection)
 <  A cursed magical item. (During magic detection)

Monsters are depicted as letters of the alphabet.  Note that all letters
denote multiple monsters, depending on which level of the Dungeon you are
on.  The player can always identify a current monster by using the identify
command ('/') or the clarify command ('=').

The bottom two lines of the screen describe the player's current status.
The first line gives the player's characteristics:

Intelligence, Strength, Wisdom, Dexterity, Charisma, and Constitution
all have a normal maximum value of 50 points, but they can go higher if
augmented by a ring.  Encumberance is a measurement of how much the player
can carry versus how much he is currently carrying. The more you carry
relative to your maximum encumberance causes you to use more food.  The
attribute of Strength fortifies one's encumberance.

The player's current number of hit points are denoted as (Hp) and it is
followed in parentheses by the player's current maximum hit points.  Hit
points express the player's survivability.  As a player heals by resting,
using potions, or spells, the player's current hit points gradually increase
until they reach the current maximum.  This maximum number will be increased
each time a player goes up an experience level.  If the player's current hit
points reach 0, the player becomes metabolically challenged.

The player's armor class is denoted as (Ac).  This number describes the
amount of protection provided by the armor, cloaks, and/or rings currently
worn by the player. It is also affected by high or low dexterity.  Wearing
no armor is equivalent to an armor class of 10 (Monk excepted).  The lower
the armor class number, the better.

The player's current experience level is denoted as (Exp), followed by
the player's experience points.  A new experience level brings extra hit
points and possibly added abilities, such as new spells for a Magic-user,
new prayers for a Cleric, and new chants for a Druid.  There are a total
of 26 experience levels per character.

Commands:

A player can invoke most commands by typing in a single character.
Some commands, however, require a direction, in which case the player
types the command character followed by a directional letter.  Many
commands can be prefaced by a number, indicating how many times the
command should be executed.

When the player invokes a command referring to an item in the player's
pack (such as reading a scroll), the game prompts for the item.  The
player can then type the letter associated with the item.  Typing a
'*' at this point, produces a list of eligible items.

A list of basic games commands:

 ?  Preceding a command by a '?' produces a brief explanation of the
    command.  The command '?*' gives an explanation of all the commands.
 /  Preceding a symbol by a '/' identifies the symbol.
 =  Clarify.  After typing an '=' sign, the player can use the movement
    keys to position the cursor anywhere on the current level.  As long
    as the player can normally see the selected position, the game will
    identify whatever is there.  
 h  Move one position to the left.
 j  Move one position down.
 k  Move one position up.
 l  Move one position to the right.
 y  Move one position to the top left.
 u  Move one position to the top right.
 b  Move one position to the bottom left.
 n  Move one position to the bottom right.
 H  Run to the left until reaching something interesting.
 J  Run down until reaching something interesting.
 K  Run up until reaching something interesting.
 L  Run to the right until reaching something interesting.
 Y  Run to the top left until reaching something interesting.
 U  Run to the top right until reaching something interesting.
 B  Run to the bottom left until reaching something interesting.
 N  Run to the bottom right until reaching something interesting.
 >  Go down to the next level.
 <  Go up to the next level.
 *  Count the gold in the player's pack.
 !  Escape to the shell level.
 $  Price an item at the Trading Post.
 #  Buy an item at the Trading Post.

 .  This command (a period) causes the player to rest one turn.
 ^  This command sets traps and is limited to Thieves and Assassins.  If the
    command is successful the game will ask the player for the trap type and
    sets it where the player is standing.
 a  This command is restricted to Clerics and Paladins and must be followed
    by a directional letter.  
 A  Choose your quest item (at game startup only).
 c  This command is restricted to Druids and Monks and it produces a list of 
    available chants.  The player can select one of the displayed chants and
    if the player's energy level is sufficiently high, "chant" it.  The more
    complicated the spell, the more energy it will take.
 C  This command is restricted to Magic-Users and Rangers and it produces a
    list of available spells.  The player can select one of the displayed
    spells and if the player's energy level is sufficiently high, "cast" it.
    The more complicated the spell, the more energy it will take.
 d  Drop an item from the player's pack.
 D  Dip something into a magic pool.
 e  Eat some food from the player's pack.
 f  When this command is preceded with a directional command, the player will
    move in the specified direction until he crosses something interesting.
 F  Frighten a monster.  Not available to all characters.
 g  Give away or trade a slime-mold for food with a monster.
 G  This command is restricted to Thieves and Assassins.  It causes the game
    to display all of the gold on the current level.
 i  Display an inventory of the player's pack.
 I  This command prompts for an item from the player's pack and displays
    the inventory information for that item.
 m  When the player types this command, you are prompted to mark an item
    with a one-line name.  
 o  Typing this command causes the game to display all the settable options.
    The player can then examine them or change them 
 O  Display your character type and quest item.
 p  This command is restricted to Clerics and Paladins and it produces a
    list of available prayers.  The player can then select one of the
    displayed prayers and if the player's energy level is sufficiently high,
    "pray" it.  The more complicated the prayer, the more energy it will take.
 P  Pick up the items currently under the player.
 q  Quaff a potion from the player's pack.
 Q  Quit without saving the game.
 r  Read a scroll from the player's pack.
 s  Search for a secret door or a trap in the circle surrounding the player.
 S  Save your game to play at a later time.
 t  This command prompts for an object from the players pack.  The player
    then throws the object in the specified direction.
 T  Take off whatever the player is wearing.
 v  Print the current xrogue version number.
 w  Wield a weapon from the player's pack.
 W  Wear some armor, ring, or a miscellaneous magic item from the player's
    pack.  The player can wear a maximum of 8 rings.
 X  This command is restricted to Thieves only.  It causes the game to display
    all of the hidden traps on the current level.
 z  This command prompts for a wand or staff from the player's pack and zaps
    it in the specified direction.

 Escape  Pressing the Escape key will cancel the current command.
 Ctrl-B  Check your current score.  Scoring is based on experience points
         and gold, although gold is not that important and 10% is hacked off
         if a player is killed rather than becoming a total winner.
 Ctrl-E  Check your current food level.  This command is used when you want
         to see just how much food you have remaining in your stomach.  A
         full stomach is measured to be about 2000(2100).  As you play the
         game, this level drops until you become hungry at about 200(2100).
         A food level over 2000(2100) makes the character satiated, and a
         level under 200(2100) makes the character hungry, then weak, and
         finally fainting.  A level of 2000(2100) is the most the character
         can eat, a full, satisfied stomach.
 Ctrl-L  Redraw the screen.
 Ctrl-N  When the player types this command, the game prompts you to type a
         one-line name for a monster or for an item in the player's pack
         To name a monster, position the cursor over the desired monster and
         rename it.  
 Ctrl-O  Display current affects on the player.
 Ctrl-R  Repeat last message displayed on the top line of the screen.
 Ctrl-T  This command is restricted to Thieves and Assassins.  It must be
         followed by a directional letter.  If a monster is standing next to
         the player in the specified direction, the effect is to steal an
         item from the monster's pack.  If successful, the monster does not
         notice anything, but if the player is unsuccessful, there is a chance
         the monster will suddenly wake up.
 Ctrl-U  Use a magic item in the player's pack.

There is no explicit attack command.  If a player wishes to do battle with a
monster, the player simply moves onto the spot where the monster is standing.
Whatever the player is wielding will be used as the player's weapon.

As the player moves across items, the game automatically picks them up and
places them into the player's pack.  If there is no room left in the pack,
the item is left on the floor.

All actions except for purely bookkeeping commands, such as taking an
inventory, take time.  The amount of time varies with the command.  Swinging
a weapon, for example, takes more time than simply moving; so a monster could
move several spaces in the time it takes the player to make one attack.  The
time it takes to swing a weapon also varies based on the bulk of the weapon,
and the time it takes to simply move one space varies with the type of armor
worn and the player's level of encumberance.  Movement is always faster when
the player is flying.

Actions also take time and some of them can be disrupted.  If the player is
casting a spell for example, and gets hit before finishing it, the spell is
lost.  Similarly, the player might choke if hit while trying to eat.  These
same rules apply to monsters as well.

Some of the rooms in the Dungeon possess a natural light source.  In most
other rooms and in corridors, the player can see only those things within
a one-space radius around the player.  Dark rooms can be lit with magical
light or by fire beetles and other monsters.

The player can wield exactly one weapon at a time.  When a player attacks
a monster, the amount of damage depends on the particular weapon he is
wielding.  To fire a projectile weapon, such as a crossbow or a short bow,
the player should wield the bow and throw the bolt or arrow at the monster.

A weapon may be cursed or blessed which will affect the likelihood of you
hitting a monster with it and the damage that it will inflict on the monster.
If the player has identified the weapon he is using, the "to hit" and the
"to damage" bonuses appear (in that order) before the weapons name in the
inventory listing.  A positive bonus indicates a blessed weapon, and a
negative bonus usually indicates a cursed or misguided weapon.  A player
cannot release a cursed weapon until a remove curse scroll is read or cast
by magical means.

After the player has identified a suit of armor, the protection bonus appears
before the armors name in the inventory listing.  If the bonus is positive,
the armor is blessed and if it is negative, the armor is usually cursed.
The player cannot remove a cursed suit of armor until a remove curse scroll
is read or cast by magical means.

Some monsters can corrode your armor!  If such a monster hits a player
when the player is wearing metal armor, the armor will lose some of its
protective value.  This same corrosive property also applies to weapons
when a player hits a monster with this ability.

A player will find many potions and scrolls in the Dungeon.  Quaffing a
potion or reading a scroll will usually cause some magical occurrence.
Potions and scrolls may be cursed or blessed.

The player can wear a maximum of ten rings and some of them have a magical
effect on the player, as long as they are worn.  Some rings also speed up
the player's metabolism, making the player require food more often.  Rings
can be cursed or blessed and the player cannot remove a cursed ring until
a remove curse scroll is read or cast.  

Wands, rods, and staves help a player in battle and affect the Dungeon.
A player uses the "z" (zap) command to use a wand either to shoot at a
monster, teleport, or to light up a dark room.  Wands can be cursed or
blessed.  

A player must be frugal with his food.  Both moving and searching through
the Dungeon, and fighting monsters, consumes energy.  Starving results in
the player's fainting for increasingly longer periods of time, during which
any nearby monster can attack the player for free.  Food comes in the form
of standard rations and as a variety of berries.  Some berries have side
effects in addition to satisfying one's hunger.  Slime-Molds are monster
food and if you have one, you may be able to trade it for a regular food
ration, if the monster is a friendly type.

Gold has one use in the Dungeon.  Buying things.  A player can buy things
in two different ways: either in a Trading Post or from a Quartermaster.
The Trading Post is entered via the '>' command, just like going down a
stairway.  A Quartermaster ('q') is a Dungeon vendor who sometimes appears
and attempts to sell a player some of his wares.  The Quartermaster's wares
are never cursed but are frequently blessed, though blessed goods do cost
more than normal goods.  If the player chooses to buy one of the items 
offered by a Quartermaster, the Quartermaster will make the transaction
for the specified amount of gold and then disappear.  Attacking a
Quartermaster causes him to vanish with his wares!

When beginning a new game, a player is placed in the Trading Post with
an allotment of gold, based upon the type of character chosen to play.
There are some restrictions on the use of certain items by character.
For example, only Fighters, Paladins, and Rangers can wield two-handed
swords while Thieves and Assassins can not wear certain types of armor.
The Trading Post or Quartermaster will happily sell a player anything
that he can afford, whether you need it or not.

Miscellaneous magical items such as a Pair of Boots or a Book are numerous
within the Dungeon.  These items are usually used to a player's advantage,
assuming they are not cursed.  Some of these items can be worn, such as a
Cloak, while others are to be used, such as a Book, or a Beaker.

Some of the unique monsters, down in the depths of the Dungeon carry very
magical artifacts.  When you begin the game, you are asked to choose your
quest item to retrieve from the Dungeon.  Most of these items can be used
to the player's advantage even if they are not your personal quest item.
However, care must be taken when handling them for they have intelligence
and some will reject mishandling or abuse.  These items consume food and
simply carrying them around will result in your increased food use.  Some
of these items kill you immediately if you happen to pick them up while
wielding another weapon or artifact.  Don't be greedy with the artifacts!

A variety of traps exist within the Dungeon, including trap doors, bear
traps, and sleeping traps, sometimes hidden from sight until sprung by a
monster or by the player.  A sprung trap continues to function, but since
it is visible, an intelligent monster is not likely to tread on it.

Each monster except for the Quartermaster appears in a limited range of
Dungeon levels.  All monsters of the same type share the same abilities.
All giant rats, for example, can give the player a disease, and all
jackalweres can put the player to sleep.  Monsters of the same type will
till vary, in strength and intelligence.  One kobold may be much more
difficult to kill than another.  In general, the more difficult it is to
kill a monster, the more experience points the monster is worth.

Most monsters attack by biting and clawing, but some monsters carry weapons
and can use their breath as a weapon.  Some monsters can even use magical
items, such as wands and artifacts.  Monsters with distance weapons or magic
can sometimes attack a player from across a room or from down a corridor.

Some monsters are more intelligent than others, and the more intelligent a
monster is the more likely it will run away if it is about to die.  A fleeing
monster will not attack the player unless cornered.

It is sometimes possible to enlist a monster's aid.  Reading a charm monster
scroll, for example, or singing a charm monster chant can make a monster
believe that the player is its friend.  A charmed monster will fight hostile
monsters for the player as long as they are not of its own race.

As the player moves deeper into the Dungeon, the monsters get more powerful.
Deep in the Dungeon there exist one-of-a-kind or "unique" monsters.  Once a
unique monster is killed the player will not find another one in the Dungeon.

Options:

The game has several options which may be set by the player at the beginning
of the game or during the course of play.

      default - Play character with default attribute settings.
        terse - Shorten messages at top of screen.
         jump - Speed up the display of the player's movement
         step - Lists all inventories one line at a time.
      overlay - Allows listings of inventories to overlay the currnt screen.
        flush - Flushes all typeahead characters.
        askme - Prompt the player to name new types of scrolls, potions, etc.
       pickup - Pick up items automatically as you move across them 
         name - Player's name.
         file - Saved game filename.  Defaults to xrogue.save.
        score - Identifies the location of the game scorefile.
         type - Specifies the character type (unchangable).
 quested item - Set at start up (unchangeable).

A player can set the game options at the beginning of a game via
the ROGUEOPTS environment variable.  Naming a option sets it.

A couple of examples:

  ROGUEOPTS="default nopickup, nooverlay, name=Corwin, class=magician"
  ROGUEOPTS="pickup, overlay, file=xrg.sav, score=/home/games/scorefile"

The player may change an option at any time during the game via the "o"
(option) command. On the options menu, typing a new value changes the
option and a RETURN moves to the next option in the list.  Typing an '-'
moves you to the previous option and an ESCAPE returns to the Dungeon.

When a player gets killed, his score will be equal to the amount of
experience points gained, plus his gold (minus 10%).  A player that
quits the game will not lose 10% of his gold.  If a player makes it back
up and out of the Dungeon alive, his score will be equal to the amount
of experience points, plus the gold, plus additional gold received from
selling all of his possessions. 

The game maintains a Top-Twenty player scorefile.  As an installation
option, the game may be compiled so as to record only three entries per
character type and login id.  




Here are some of the features of XRogue 8.0 (these are from the original
notes on the game, they may or may not be currently accurate).

1)  New option called "default" was added.  When you put the word default
    into your environment variable ROGUEOPTS your character will be rolled
    with "default" attribute settings, armor, weapon, quest item, and food.

    This then, skips the beginning screen where you choose/distribute the
    attribute points and also skips the beginning "equippage screen" where
    you are able to choose your own armor, weapon, quest item, and etc.

    If you also use the "class" option in your ROGUEOPTS variable, you
    will start the game immediately at level 1 with default selections.
    Example:

    ROGUEOPTS="class=magician, default, name=Joe, nopickup, overlay"
    export ROGUEOPTS

    The other options tell the game that you don't want to automatically
    want to pick up items as you step over them and overlay the screen
    with menus (ie, don't blank and pause the screens).  If you don't set
    "class" you will be able to choose your character type before you
    are placed on level 1.

2)  The nine character types have been modified to the point where you 
    really have to take advantage of their various attributes during play.

    Here's a list of their main and secondary attributes, special ability,
    and each character's "default" quest item:

    Character Main Attr.    Secondary     Specialties       Quest Item
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Fighter   strength      constitution  sense gold        Axe of Aklad
    Ranger    charisma      intelligence  cast spells       Mandolin of Brian
    Paladin   charisma      wisdom        affect undead     Ankh of Heil
    Cleric    wisdom        dexterity     prayer spells     Horn of Geryon
    Magician  intelligence  dexterity     cast spells       Stonebones Amulet
    Thief     dexterity     strength      sense traps       Musty Daggers
    Assassin  dexterity     strength      steal/use poison  Eye of Vecna
    Druid     wisdom        dexterity     chant spells      Quill of Nagrom
    Monk      constitution  dexterity     chant spells      Emori Cloak

    A different quest item may be chosen while you are in the beginning
    equippage room (if you've not set the "default" option via ROGUEOPTS).

    Also, the Ranger, Paladin, and Monk characters do not receive their
    "special" abilities until they've gained some experience levels.
    These three characters are derivative of the Magician, Cleric, and
    Druid characters, with some of the Fighter's abilities as well.

3)  The outer region has been enhanced.  This is the area you find yourself
    in if you go up the stairs from level 1 _before_ you obtain your quest
    item.  Dinosaurs inhabit this area and you will also find magic items
    here as well.

4)  A new trap was added called wormhole.  It sends you to the outer region
    if you happen to fall into it.  You will remain at the same dungeon
    level, until you find a staircase back out.  Dinosaurs get tougher at
    the deeper levels.

5)  New commands and/or changes made to current commands:

    '?' gives help as before but you can now type '?@' which will display
    the things that you may encounter (solid rock, potion, forest, etc).

    '>' go down the stairs, dive into a magic pool, or enter a trap (you
    have to be flying and/or wearing Elven boots to stand on traps).

    '<" go up the stairs or enter the outer region if your standing
        upon the wormhole trap.

    'A' choose your quest item (must be done in beginning equippage room.

    'F' Frighten a monster (the "good" characters can use this command
    to scare away monsters that they don't want to kill but are in
    their way.  The command will lose power at around level 10.

    'g' give food to monsters (slime-molds) also important when trying
    to obtain a certain quest item.

    'G' sense for gold (if your character has this ability).

    'O' display your character type and quest item.

    'X' sense for traps (if your character has this ability).

    '^' set a trap (if your character has this ability).

    '+' get your fortune (warning: if you play over a modem typing three
    consecutive '+' will tell your modem to enter command mode.  See
    your modem manual on how to get back out.

    'ctrl-b' tally up your current score (if you were to win).

    'ctrl-e' check your current food level (satiated, weak, or fainting).

    'ctrl-o' your character's status (fast, blind, protected, dancing, etc).

6)  Changes to scrolls and potions, rings, misc magic, and quest items:

    You can now wear up to 8 rings, four per hand.

    Scrolls: 
    - Monster confusion turns your hands a variety of colors (no biggie).
    - Fixed magic mapping for very detailed maps
    - Genocide works on monsters in the dungeon; dinosaurs in the outer region.
    - Blessed teleportation teleports you up a few levels.
    - Blessed remove curse will cause some monsters to panic.
    - Charm monster lets you charm a few monsters which will then follow you
      down the dungeon levels (if they are in room when you go downstairs).

    Potions:
    - Clear thought, extra sight, phasing, flying, and cold/fire/lightning
      protection potions last a bit longer if they are blessed when quaffed.

    Misc magic items:
    - You can use Keoghtoms ointment a few more times before it will empty.
    - The Beaker of Potions and Book of Spells hold a few more items.
    - The Book of Skills can change you into a different character (it used
      to just do an increase level).
    - The Medicine Crystal is a new misc magic item that cures you. 

    Quest items (relics):
    - These items used to appear at level 40.  They now will appear between
      levels 40-50, the less traumatic ones earlier.
    - The Card of Alteran is a new quest item and requires some strategy
      to obtain it from it's carrier.
